Data Structures in C:
1.	Abstractions – High level description of a structure
2.	A queue and a stack are abstract data structures
3.	This means they’re up to the programmer to decide how they work.
4.	Queue = FIFO
5.	Stack = LIFO
6.	Enqueueing – Adding elements
7.	Dequeueing – Deleting elements
8.	when we type the following code:
a.	typedef struct {
b.	…
c.	…
d.	} queue;
9.	We are actually creating a data type with the name queue. Its structure is a struct, with whatever we defined inside it. 
10.	If we did not write typedef, then we would just have a single structure called queue.
11.	But now that we wrote typedef, we can reuse the word queue to create a similar data type whenever we want.
12.	typedef just allowed us to create a data type essentially.
